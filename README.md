# FlymasterSync

FlymasterSync is a project born from my personal need of having an easy to use application to synchronize my flymaster’s logbook with my computer.

Compared with other similar software available on the net, FlymasterSync offers an intuitive user interface that doesn’t require any previous configuration: just plug in your flymaster and press sync.

FlymasterSync also offers an integration with Doarama, allowing to upload flights tracks to your personal Doarama account.

The Doarama features are subject to Doarama’s terms of use
